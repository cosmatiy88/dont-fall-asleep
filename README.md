# Don't Fall Asleep

Don't Fall Asleep is a web app that uses your webcam to detect if you have fallen asleep. If your eyes are closed, or your head is out of the frame, you are considered asleep and the app will play an audio file of your choice to wake you up. The sound will stop playing only when it detects your eyes again.
